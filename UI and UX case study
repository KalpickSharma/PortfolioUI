# Objective
As a beginner UI/UX designer, the goal of this project was to:

Understand how to structure a personal portfolio website

Design a UI that is visually pleasing yet simple to implement

Build something other community members can reuse and personalize

# Target Audience
Creative professionals (developers, designers, digital artists)

Community members needing a personal site to showcase their identity and work

First-time users who expect smooth navigation and quick scanning

## Visual Choices
Color Palette: Soft lavender, monochrome elements — evokes calm, creative energy

Typography: Typewriter-style font (monospaced) paired with clean sans-serif — gives personality + readability

Whitespace: Generous margins improve scannability

Images: Carefully placed to emphasize visual storytelling

// Responsiveness (Planned)
While this is only a static design, I’ve followed a 12-column structure and used modular sections to ensure mobile-friendliness when implemented.

// UX Considerations
F-shaped reading pattern with left-heavy layout flow

Clear CTAs at natural scroll intervals

Use of repetition (structure, layout spacing) for cognitive ease

Accessible color contrast and readable text blocks
